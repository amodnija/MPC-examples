Live Script is a new interactive document format for MATLAB in which
live formulas, graphics and general output can be dynamically emdebed
into a formated document.

You will need MATLAB version R2016b or later for Live Scripts to
work. Alternatively, download the m files from the book website.

These documents will allow you to generate all figures and perform
many of the calculations that you find in the book.

They also introduces various MATLAB commands and can be used as a
supplement material to suport students in their homework problems.
